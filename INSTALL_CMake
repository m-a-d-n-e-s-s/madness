# Introduction

When configuring MADNESS with CMake, you must specify cache variables and the
path to the MADNESS source directory. To specify a cache variable prefix it with
the -D command line flag and set it equal to the desired value (see below for a
valid cache variables). For example, to specify the C/C++ compilers

    $ cmake -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ \
        /path/to/madness/source

The resulting build directory will be the current working directory specified
where the CMake command it run. It is recommended that you configure and build
MADNESS outside the source tree. Boolean values for cache variables are 
considered true if the constant is 1, ON, YES, TRUE, Y, or a non-zero number; or
false if the constant is 0, OFF, NO, FALSE, N, or IGNORE.

# Toolchain files

MADNESS provides toolchain files for select systems. It is recommended that you
use these files if provided as they contain the platform specific settings
neccessary to build on the given platform. The toolchain files are included wiht
the MADNESS source in the cmake/toolchains directory.

* CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE --- Specifies the path (including the file name) to the
      toolchain file.

For example, to specify the toolchain file for Mira:

    $ cmake -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/madness/source/cmake/toolchains/mira-gcc-essl.cmake \
        /path/to/madness/source

Additional cache variables may be specified. 

# Compiler variables

The following CMake cache variables are used to specify the compilers, compiler
flags, and linker flags.

* CMAKE_C_COMPILER --- C compiler [default=search]
* CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER --- C++ compiler [default=search]
* CMAKE_ASM_COMPILER --- Assembly compiler (set only if required) 
      [default=search]
* MPI_CXX_COMPILER --- MPI C++ compiler wrapper (required if ENABLE_MPI=ON) 
      [default=search]
* MPI_C_COMPILER --- MPI C compiler wrapper (required if ENABLE_MPI=ON) 
      [default=search]
      
You can specify compile flags with the following variables. These cache variables
are optional, and it is typically not necessary to specify these variables.

* CMAKE_C_FLAGS --- Compile flags passed to the C compiler
* CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS --- Compile flags passed to the C++ compiler
* CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS --- Linker flags to be used to create executables.
* CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS --- Linker flags to be used to create static 
      libraries.
* CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS --- Linker flags to be used to create shared 
      libraries.

# Build options

The following CMake cache variables turn MADNESS features on and off.

* ENABLE_GENTENSOR --- Enable generic tensors; only useful if need
                       compressed 6-d tensors, e.g. in MP2 [default=OFF]
* ENABLE_TASK_PROFILER - Enable task profiler that collects per-task start and 
      stop times. [default=OFF]
* ENABLE_WORLD_PROFILE --- Enables world profiling [default=OFF]
* ENABLE_MEM_STATS --- Gather memory statistics (expensive) (default=OFF)
* ENABLE_TENSOR_BOUNDS_CHECKING --- Enable checking of bounds in tensors ... 
      slow but useful for debugging [default=OFF]
* ENABLE_TENSOR_INSTANCE_COUNT --- Enable counting of allocated tensors for 
      memory leak detection [default=OFF]
* ENABLE_SPINLOCKS --- Enables use of spinlocks instead of mutexes (faster 
      unless over subscribing processors) [default=ON]
* ENABLE_NEVER_SPIN --- Disables use of spinlocks (notably for use inside
      virtual machines [default=OFF]
* ENABLE_BSEND_ACKS --- Use MPI Send instead of MPI Bsend for huge message 
      acknowledgements [default=ON]
* ENABLE_UNITTESTS --- Enables unit tests targets [default=ON]
* FORTRAN_INTEGER_SIZE --- Set the fortran integer size (4 or 8 bytes) used for 
      BLAS and LAPACK function calls [default=4]
* ASSERTION_TYPE --- Define MADNESS assertion behavior
      (abort|assert|disable|throw) [default=throw]
* MPI_THREAD --- Thread level for MPI (multiple|serialized)" [default=multiple]
* BUILD_SHARED_LIBS --- Enable shared libraries. This option is only available
      if the platform supports shared libraries [default=ON]

# External libraries

The following CMake cache variables enable the use of external libraries with
MADNESS. If the WITH_* variable is set to "ON" by default, failure to find the
external library is not an error. If you explicitly set a WITH_* variable to 
"ON" when the default is set to "OFF," an error will occur if the library is
not found.

* CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH - A semicolon seperated list of paths that are used when 
      searching for external libraries and dependencies. You may use this CMake
      cache variable to specify the prefix for any of the dependencies, or you
      may specify path for individual components below.

* ENABLE_MPI --- Enable use of MPI, should specify MPI_CXX_COMPILER or MPI_C_COMPILER
                 explicitly or have them in PATH; if not found will use StubMPI and
                 be limited to 1 process [default=ON]

In the following section, each optional library privides four variables that
the user can use to enable cmake to find the correct dependencies: 
  * ENABLE_<LIB> --- Enable the library feathres (ON|OFF)
  * <LIB>_ROOT_DIR --- Prefix path used to search for the external library.
  * <LIB>_INCLUDE_DIR --- The external library include path. By default the
        include path is ${<LIB>_ROOT_DIR}/include, if <LIB>_ROOT_DIR is
        specified in the configure command.
  * <LIB>_LIBRARY --- The external library path. By default the
        include path is ${<LIB>_ROOT_DIR}/(lib64|lib), if <LIB>_ROOT_DIR is
        specified in the configure command.
If the <LIB>_ROOT_DIR, <LIB>_INCLUDE_DIR, and <LIB>_LIBRARY will be used to
search for specific dependencies. If the external library is not found in these
given paths, or if the paths are not given, CMake will search the paths in 
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH as well as other system paths.

Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB):

* ENABLE_TBB --- Enables use of Intel TBB as the task scheduler [default=ON]
* TBB_ROOT_DIR --- The install prefix for TBB
* TBB_INCLUDE_DIR --- The path to the TBB include directory
* TBB_LIBRARY --- The path to the TBB library directory. By default, the library
      search path is ${TBB_ROOT_DIR}/(lib/intel64/gcc4.4|lib) on Linux and
      ${TBB_ROOT_DIR}/(lib/libc++|lib) on OS X, if TBB_ROOT_DIR is specified in
      the configure command.

Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL):

* ENABLE_MKL --- Search for Intel MKL for BLAS and LAPACK support [default=ON]
* MKL_ROOT_DIR --- The install prefix for MKL.
* MKL_LIBRARY --- The path to the MKL library directory.

AMD Core Math Library (ACML):

* ENABLE_ACML --- Search for AMD math library for BLAS and LAPACK support
      [default=ON]
* ACML_ROOT_DIR --- The install prefix for ACML.
* ACML_LIBRARY --- The path to the ACML library directory.

Google Performance Tools (Gperftools):

* ENABLE_GPERFTOOLS --- Enable use of gperftools, including tcmalloc.
      [default=ON]
* ACML_ROOT_DIR --- The install prefix for ACML.
* ACML_INCLUDE_DIR --- The path to the ACML include directory.
* ACML_LIBRARY --- The path to the ACML library directory.

Library of Exchange-Correlation DFT functionals (LIBXC):

* ENABLE_LIBXC --- Enables use of the libxc library of density functionals.
      [default=ON]
* LIBXC_ROOT_DIR --- The install prefix for LIBXC.
* LIBXC_INCLUDE_DIR --- The path to the LIBXC include directory.
* LIBXC_LIBRARY --- The path to the LIBXC library directory.

Performance Application Programming Interface (PAPI):

* ENABLE_PAPI --- Enables use of PAPI [default=OFF]
* PAPI_ROOT_DIR --- The install prefix for PAPI.
* PAPI_INCLUDE_DIR --- The path to the PAPI include directory.
* PAPI_LIBRARY --- The path to the PAPI library directory.

Elemental parallel linear algebra library:

Elemental provides optional distributed-memory linear algebra for some MADNESS application codes.
MADNESS source includes (modified) Elemental v0.84, which has been validated to work with
the few MADNESS apps that can use Elemental. You can instruct MADNESS to download and compile
a more recent version of Elemental, if desired, but the apps will not use Elemental then.
Such bundling is currently necessary if your code uses the MADworld runtime AND Elemental because
madness::initialize will call El::initialize() .

* ENABLE_ELEMENTAL --- Enable Elemental [default=OFF].
* ELEMENTAL_TAG --- specifies the version of Elemental to be downloaded, compiled, and installed alongside
                    MADNESS (numerical codes of MADNESS will not use Elemental).
                    If not set, will use the included Elemental source.
