abstract = {We describe the evaluation of response properties using multiresolution multiwavelet (MRMW) basis sets. The algorithm uses direct projection of the perturbed density operator onto the zeroth order density operator on the real space spanned by the MRMW basis set and is applied for evaluating the polarizability of small molecules using Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham density functional theory. The computed polarizabilities can be considered to be converged to effectively complete space within the requested precision. The efficiency of the method against the ordinary Gaussian basis computation is discussed.},

abstract = {We present an approach to compute accurate correlation energies for atoms and molecules using an adaptive discontinuous spectral-element multiresolution representation for the two-electron wave function. Because of the exponential storage complexity of the spectral-element representation with the number of dimensions, a brute-force computation of two-electron (six-dimensional) wave functions with high precision was not practical. To overcome the key storage bottlenecks we utilized (1) a low-rank tensor approximation (specifically, the singular value decomposition) to compress the wave function, and (2) explicitly correlated R12-type terms in the wave function to regularize the Coulomb electron-electron singularities of the Hamiltonian. All operations necessary to solve the Schr\"{o}dinger equation were expressed so that the reconstruction of the full-rank form of the wave function is never necessary. Numerical performance of the method was highlighted by computing the first-order M\o ller-Plesset wave function of a helium atom. The computed second-order M\o ller-Plesset energy is precise to \~{}2 microhartrees, which is at the precision limit of the existing general atomic-orbital-based approaches. Our approach does not assume special geometric symmetries, hence application to molecules is straightforward.},

  abstract = {We develop a multiresolution representation of a class of integral operators satisfying boundary conditions on simple domains in order to construct fast algorithms for their application. We also elucidate some delicate theoretical issues related to the construction of 
periodic Green's functions for Poisson's equation.  By applying the method of images to the non-standard form of the free space operator, we obtain lattice sums that converge absolutely on all scales, except possibly on the coarsest scale. On the coarsest scale the lattice sums may 
be only conditionally convergent and, thus, allow for some freedom in their definition. We use the limit of square partial sums as a definition of the limit and obtain a systematic, simple approach to the construction (in any dimension) of periodized operators with sparse non-standa
rd forms.  We illustrate the results on several examples in dimensions one and three: the Hilbert transform, the projector on divergence free functions, the non-oscillatory Helmholtz Green's function and the Poisson operator. Remarkably, the limit of square partial sums yields a per
iodic Poisson Green's function which is not a convolution.  Using a short sum of decaying Gaussians to approximate periodic Green's functions, we arrive at fast algorithms for their application. We further show that the results obtained for operators with periodic boundary condition
s extend to operators with Dirichlet, Neumann, or mixed boundary conditions.},

@article{Beste2006,
abstract = {Chemists are mainly interested in energy differences. In contrast, most quantum chemical methods yield the total energy which is a large number compared to the difference and has therefore to be computed to a higher relative precision than would be necessary for the difference alone. Hence, it is desirable to compute energy differences directly, thereby avoiding the precision problem. Whenever it is possible to find a parameter which transforms smoothly from an initial to a final state, the energy difference can be obtained by integrating the energy derivative with respect to that parameter (cf. thermodynamic integration or adiabatic connection methods). If the dependence on the parameter is predominantly linear, accurate results can be obtained by single-point integration. In density functional theory and Hartree-Fock, we applied the formalism to ionization potentials, excitation energies, and chemical bond breaking. Example calculations for ionization potentials and excitation energies showed that accurate results could be obtained with a linear estimate. For breaking bonds, we introduce a nongeometrical parameter which gradually turns the interaction between two fragments of a molecule on. The interaction changes the potentials used to determine the orbitals as well as the constraint on the orbitals to be orthogonal.},

abstract = {With recent advances in electronic structure methods, first-principles calculations of electronic response properties, such as linear and nonlinear polarizabilities, have become possible for molecules with more than 100 atoms. Basis set incompleteness is typically the main source of error in such calculations since traditional diffuse augmented basis sets are too costly to use or suffer from near linear dependence. To address this problem, we construct the first comprehensive set of property-optimized augmented basis sets for elements H-Rn except lanthanides. The new basis sets build on the Karlsruhe segmented contracted basis sets of split-valence to quadruple-zeta valence quality and add a small number of moderately diffuse basis functions. The exponents are determined variationally by maximization of atomic Hartree-Fock polarizabilities using analytical derivative methods. The performance of the resulting basis sets is assessed using a set of 313 molecular static Hartree-Fock polarizabilities. The mean absolute basis set errors are 3.6\%, 1.1\%, and 0.3\% for property-optimized basis sets of split-valence, triple-zeta, and quadruple-zeta valence quality, respectively. Density functional and second-order M\o ller-Plesset polarizabilities show similar basis set convergence. We demonstrate the efficiency of our basis sets by computing static polarizabilities of icosahedral fullerenes up to C(720) using hybrid density functional theory.},

Furthermore, the excellent scaling with the number of atoms opens the way to the investigation of response properties of very large molecular systems. To demonstrate the capabilities of this method, they implemented it in a real-space (basis-set-free) code and applied it to benchmark molecules, namely, CO, H2O, and para-nitroaniline.

@article{Weijo2009,
abstract = {The first implementation of a wavelet discretization of the Integral Equation Formalism (IEF) for the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) is presented here. The method is based on the application of a general purpose wavelet solver on the cavity boundary to solve the integral equations of the IEF-PCM problem. Wavelet methods provide attractive properties for the solution of the electrostatic problem at the cavity boundary: the system matrix is highly sparse and iterative solution schemes can be applied efficiently; the accuracy of the solver can be increased systematically and arbitrarily; for a given system, discretization error accuracy is achieved at a computational expense that scales linearly with the number of unknowns. The scaling of the computational time with the number of atoms N is formally quadratic but a N(1.5) scaling has been observed in practice. The current bottleneck is the evaluation of the potential integrals at the cavity boundary which scales linearly with the system size. To reduce this overhead, interpolation of the potential integrals on the cavity surface has been successfully used.},

@article{Bischoff2012,
abstract = {We present an approach to compute accurate correlation energies for atoms and molecules using an adaptive discontinuous spectral-element multiresolution representation for the two-electron wave function. Because of the exponential storage complexity of the spectral-element representation with the number of dimensions, a brute-force computation of two-electron (six-dimensional) wave functions with high precision was not practical. To overcome the key storage bottlenecks we utilized (1) a low-rank tensor approximation (specifically, the singular value decomposition) to compress the wave function, and (2) explicitly correlated R12-type terms in the wave function to regularize the Coulomb electron-electron singularities of the Hamiltonian. All operations necessary to solve the Schr\"{o}dinger equation were expressed so that the reconstruction of the full-rank form of the wave function is never necessary. Numerical performance of the method was highlighted by computing the first-order M\o ller-Plesset wave function of a helium atom. The computed second-order M\o ller-Plesset energy is precise to \~{}2 microhartrees, which is at the precision limit of the existing general atomic-orbital-based approaches. Our approach does not assume special geometric symmetries, hence application to molecules is straightforward.},
