# QCSchema Json

Integration of Madness into QCArchive requires to ability to translate data
generated by Madness into a standard quantum chemistry variable defined in 
`QCSchema`.  Within QCEngine, the madness `harvester.py` code is responible 
for reading in madness output files and harvesting relevant output data.  
This is done using the `regex` python api which pattern matches.  

`json.hpp` is included to allow applications to write json files with
relevant Quantum Chemistry data.  The ultimate goal is to be able
to generate data requested by QCArchive according to the `QCSchema` as
explained (QCSchema)['https://molssi-qc-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_props.html'].

This ways we generate `json` output files that can easily be read within 
QCA.

## Wavefunction Schema

A list of valid quantum chemistry wavefunction properties tracked byu the schema.  
Matrices are in column-major order. AO basis functions are ordered according to the CCA standard as implemented in libint.
