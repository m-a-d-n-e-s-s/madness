  abstract = {Dalton is a powerful general-purpose program system for the study of molecular electronic structure at the Hartree--Fock, Kohn--Sham, multiconfigurational self-consistent-field, M{\o}ller--Plesset, configuration-interaction, and coupled-cluster levels of theory. Apart from the total energy, a wide variety of molecular properties may be calculated using these electronic-structure models. Molecular gradients and Hessians are available for geometry optimizations, molecular dynamics, and vibrational studies, whereas magnetic resonance and optical activity can be studied in a gauge-origin-invariant manner. Frequency-dependent molecular properties can be calculated using linear, quadratic, and cubic response theory. A large number of singlet and triplet perturbation operators are available for the study of one-, two-, and three-photon processes. Environmental effects may be included using various dielectric-medium and quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics models. Large molecules may be studied using linear-scaling and massively parallel algorithms. Dalton is distributed at no cost from http://www.daltonprogram.org for a number of UNIX platforms.

  abstract = {We have examined the response of an exact and an MCSCF reference state to a general time-dependent field. The time development of both the exact and the MCSCF reference state have been parametrized in terms of explicit exponential time-dependent transformations. The time development has been determined by requiring the Ehrenfest theorem to be satisfied through each order in the interaction between the molecular system and the field. The response of the exact and the MCSCF reference state has been used to evaluate linear, quadratic, and cubic response functions. It has been shown how a large variety of molecular properties may be expressed in terms of these response functions. It has also been demonstrated that molecular properties containing the electric dipole operator may be expressed in equivalent forms involving the momentum operator both for the exact and the MCSCF state. The MCSCF response functions have been transformed to computationally attractive expressions which do not contain summation indices over intermediate states and which allow direct techniques to be straightforwardly applied.},

  abstract = {We report on the efficient turbomole implementation of quadratic response properties within the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) context that includes the static and dynamic dipole hyperpolarizability, ground-to-excited-state two-photon absorption amplitudes (through a single residue) and state-to-state one-photon absorption amplitudes (through a double residue). Our implementation makes full use of arbitrary (including non-Abelian) point-group symmetry as well as permutational symmetry and enables the calculation of nonlinear properties with hybrid density functionals for molecules with hundreds of atoms and thousands of basis functions at a cost that is a fixed multiple of the cost of the corresponding linear properties. Using the PBE0 hybrid density functional, we show that excited-state absorption spectra computed within the pseudowavefunction approach contain the qualitative features of transient absorption spectra tracking excimer formation in perylene diimide dimers, two-photon absorption cross sections for a series of highly twisted fused porphyrin chains are semiquantitatively reproduced, and the computed dynamic hyperpolarizability of several calix[4]arene stereoisomers yield simulated hyper-Raleigh scattering signals consistent with experiment. In addition, we show that the incorrect pole structure of adiabatic TDDFT properties can cause incorrect excited-state absorption spectra and overly resonant hyperpolarizabilities, and discuss possible remedies.},
