Multiresolution Quantum Chemistry Interface
-----------------------------------------------

The goal of this project is to provide a unified interface for computing with the various quantum chemistry applications available within MADNESS.
The motivation for this project is make MADNESS more accessible to the quantum chemistry community, providing them a platform to compute
benchmark quality results with minimal effort.  Towards easy access, we aim to make this interface compatible with QCEngine, given 
users the ability define and run their computations from python jupyter notebooks.

Currently, the interface is designed to work with :code:`moldft` and :code:`molresponse` in order to compute Hartree-Fock and DFT ground and response properties including excited states.
Future work will include additional quantum chemistry methods.

Why we need MADQCEngine?
------------------------

In the currently implemtation, all quantum chemistry methods are seperate executables, even though many of them depend on
each other.  For example, in order to compute a response property, which depends both on ground and response states, the current procedure
is to first compute the ground state using :code:`moldft` and then compute the response property using :code:`molresponse`.
To do this properly, a user necessarily needs to manage details such as
where to place the response calculation in relation the ground state calculation, and how to pass the ground state calculation.
Further complications arise when trying to compute response states at multiple frequencies, or higher order response properties which 
depend on a mixture of multiple ground and response states.  Currently the locations of all files where managed outside of the
code base which can be a cumbersome process.

Instead, MADQCEngine aims to provide a unified interface to manage all of these details for the user.  The user can simply define their
calculation, and the interface will manage the details of where to place the files in a consistent manner.  Additionally, the interface
will contain logic to manage the restart of files as well as whether or not to overwrite files during restarts.  For ease of use,
all outputs will be stored json files and will include a :code:`calc_paths.json` file which will contain the paths to all of the
files generated during the calculation.
